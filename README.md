# My First Repo

Hello, world!

Using local workflow is simple:

*	Initialize the working directory
*	Modify your project
*	Add the files to the staging area
*	Commit your changes

Using the remote workflow seems complicated, but is actually really easy:

*	Add remote as origin
*	Modify your project
*	Add the files to the staging area
*	Commit your changes
*	Push the changes onto the remote
